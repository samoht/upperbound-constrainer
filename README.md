automagically update a whole bunch of opam files to include an upper bound constraint.

This program depends on unreleased code in `opam-file-format`, so if you want to use it you'll need to pin that package against https://github.com/ocaml/opam-file-format/commit/5059070c301926491418ffdc1d72f17a97479eb5 or a commit like it.

No warranty expressed or implied; if it breaks, you can keep both halves.
